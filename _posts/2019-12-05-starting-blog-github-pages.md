* Search for a good theme for your favourite [Static Site Generator](https://github.com/myles/awesome-static-generators#blogs).
* I found <https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout> to be good enough for my needs.
* Fork it, go to settings and set the repository name as the blog url, which is \<github_username\>.github.io
* Clone the git repository locally,   
  `git clone https://github.com/amr1ta/amr1ta.github.io`
* Customize the look and feel as you desire.
* Edit `_config.yml` to enter your data.
* Push the changes.
* Navigate to **Settings > GitHub Pages**
  * Following message should be displayed:  
    > Your site is ready to be published at https://\<github_username\>.github.io
  * Refresh the page following message should be displayed in green,
    > Your site is published at https://\<github_username\>.github.io  
* Your blog is ready for viewing.
* Write posts in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) inside the `_posts` directory.
